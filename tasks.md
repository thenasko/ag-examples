Tasks
===========

The most significant part of this project is collecting and organizing suitable examples in algebraic geometry. Even so, there are tasks which have nothing or very little to do with mathematics. Below is a list of items which should be added or need improvement.

* The licensing of the project should be finalized.

* Move to a dedicated github account and email address.

* A blog or mailing list could make collaboration easier.

* A tagging system in LaTeX would improve the organization of the project.
