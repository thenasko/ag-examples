Examples in algebraic geometry
===========

About
-----------

Examples in algebraic geometry is an open source project whose content is succinctly described by its name.

There are many beautiful, intructional, and inspiring examples in algebraic geometry. On the other hand, the foundations of the subject are rather technical, which makes it more difficult for students to gain geometric intuition. The aim of this project is to assemble a collection of "examples", short narratives of various phenomena, and to organize them thematically.


How to contribute
-----------

This project is the product of collaborative effort. A list of contributors is maintained [here](contributors.md).

Since the content is split into small sections, contributing is very easy. Almost any material from expository papers, short notes, blog posts, and others can be incorporated. We are also looking for people who can help editing the content. Separately, there are many small, non-mathematical tasks that need to be completed. A list of these is maintained [here](tasks.md).

If you are interested in helping, please email [nasko (guess) math.harvard.edu](mailto:nasko (guess) math.harvard.edu). The source files are currently mainteined in an SVN repository. Please ask us if you would like to access to it.


Download

You can download the entire project in one file [here](https://github.com/thenasko/ag-examples/raw/master/ag-examples.pdf).


Philosophy
-----------

This project, of course, is inspired by the [Stacks project](http://www.math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git/) and the [CRing project](http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~amathew/cr.html). Our aim is to produce a wide collection of examples which fill the gap between formally studying algebraic geometry and practicing it.
